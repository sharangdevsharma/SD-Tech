        Most robots are designed for heavy, dangerous, and repetitive tasks to achieve perfection and cut down on costs. 
        A robotic arm is a machine programmed and designed to perform specific tasks efficiently and precisely. 
        The work of a robotic arm is mostly driven by a motor and is used in different industrial sectors. 
        In this article, we will be elaborating on the workings of a robotic arm.<br><br>
        A robotic arm may be one of the main parts of an industrial robot and is a programmable mechanical arm that can perform a variety of tasks. 
        It contains several attachments through joints known as axes. Every attachment has a stepper or a servo motor that moves in a specific motion.<br><br>
        The greater the number of joints or axes, the greater the range of motion. 
        These motorised axes help the robot operate with precise movements for better accuracy.<br><br>
        The industrial robot is moved into position so it can reach workpieces by articulating robotic arms. 
        A six-axis robotic arm can move in six distinct directions for increased versatility.<br><br>
        The area that each robotic arm may use for operations is referred to as its "work envelope." Robotic arms also control the end-effector. 
        The robotic arm positions itself to access workpieces during operation and then uses the end-effector to finish a task.<br><br>
        Robotic arms also need to be programmed to carry out manufacturing tasks. Usually, a controller and a teaching pendant are used for this.
        Manual motion can be used to program some robotic arms. In the next section, we provide you with better insights into the workings of a robotic arm.
    </p><br><br>
    <h2 id="h2">AN INSIGHT INTO THE WORKING OF ROBOTIC ARM</h2> <br>
    <p>
        Robotic arms refer to a metal arm, usually made up of 4 to 6 joints, and can be used for several manufacturing applications. 
        They closely resemble a human arm, having a wrist, forearm, elbow, and shoulder. The different joints allow them the required degrees of freedom of movement.<br><br>
        he industrial robotic arm is composed of steel or cast iron. It is constructed from the base up to the wrist. 
        A robotic controller rotates each joint's associated motor. Hydraulic and pneumatic systems are utilised to power some of the bigger arms that are used to carry hefty weights.<br><br>
        The arm's function is to move the end effector, which may be used to pick up, lay down, remove, or weld a component or the complete workpiece. 
        Depending on the manufacturer's requirements, these robotic arms can be programmed to do a variety of tasks or a single task.<br><br>
        These robotic arms are used for little tasks in addition to lifting large objects, palletising hefty goods, and welding complete automobiles together. 
        Even the smallest motherboard or microprocessor may be pieced together with the precision and accuracy of a robotic arm.<br><br>
        These metal wonders will keep on working in manufacturing for many years to come.
    </p><br><br>
    <h2 id="h2">THE USE OF JOINTS IN THE WORKING OF ROBOTIC ARM</h2><br>
    <p>
        Since robotic arms were created with the human arm in mind, we usually see them with multiple joints, allowing them the freedom to move and flexibility.
        Joints are any moveable portions of the robotic arm.<br><br>
        Each joint operates independently while also forming a seamless team with the others for maximum operation. This is how a robotic arm can move up and down while 
        rotating at the same time. In a nutshell, a robotic arm cannot function without joints, and an industrial robotic arm must contain at least two joints.<br><br> 
        The manoeuvrability of the robotic arm increases with the number of joints. These joints-often referred to as axes-are crucial to defining how a robotic arm will function.
        Joints permit freedom of movement and make a robot exceedingly adaptable.<br><br>
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>
            Joints provide a structure which makes it simple to maintain and repair. Instead of making educated assumptions, 
            it is simple to trace a failure down to a joint once it manifests.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Joints are flexible, allowing the robotic arms to twist, turn, and move up and down.
        </li>
    </ul><br><br>
   </div>
   <h2 id="h2">WHAT IS THE WORK ENVELOPE OF A ROBOTIC ARM?</h2><br>
   <p>
    It is a geometrically shaped area where the manipulator robot may work. It depends on the number of degrees of freedom, size, kind, and range of end effects of the robot, 
    as well as any parts of the robot that may interact with the environment, like a claw, for instance. The number of linear or angular actuators determines the form of the envelope.<br><br>

The work envelope determines the ideal use for the robot. The size and form of the work envelope at the operating site must be specified when selecting or designing a robot for a task. 
To prevent mishaps, the envelope may occasionally need to be constrained by sensors that alert the controller.
   </p><br><br>
   <h2 id="h2">HOW DO ROBOTIC ARMS CONTROL END EFFECTORS?</h2><br>

<div>
   <p>
    A bodily component that activates in response to a stimulus. In robotics, it is a tool used to manipulate things at the end of a robotic arm. The end effector, often referred to as 
    end-of-arm tooling, is located at the end of the robot arm and only moves when a user activates it using the corresponding software.<br><br>

    To put it another way, the end effector is the one which pick and places items, puts product components together, stacks cartons and packages, etc. 
    A robotic arm is required to automate and improve a process, but the end effector allows the robot to work. Different end effectors are suitable for
     various purposes, and the choice of end effectors depends on the task at hand.
   </p><br><br>
   <h2 id="h2">HOW DO ROBOTIC ARMS PERFORM MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS?</h2><br>
   <p>Industrial robotic arms have the flexibility to handle a variety of applications, from the simplest to the most complicated tasks in the safest or harshest conditions. 
    This is one of its main advantages. In addition to removing human workers from potentially dangerous circumstances, automating these kinds of operations frees up such 
    personnel to perform high-value duties like interacting with clients. The following are some of the most widespread applications for robotic arms in manufacturing today:
