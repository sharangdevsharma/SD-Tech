     <h2 id="h2"> What is Data? </h2>
    </div><br>
  
   <div>
    <p>
        The quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, which may be stored and transmitted
        in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media.<br><br>
        <i>Now, let’s learn <b>Big Data definition</b></i>
    </p><br>
    <h2 id="h2">What is Big Data?</h2> <br>
    <p>
        <b>Big Data</b> is a collection of data that is huge in volume, yet growing exponentially with time.
        It is a data with so large size and complexity that none of traditional data management tools can store it or process it efficiently.
        Big data is also a data but with huge size.

    <h2 id="h2">THE USE OF JOINTS IN THE WORKING OF ROBOTIC ARM</h2><br>
    <p>
        Since robotic arms were created with the human arm in mind, we usually see them with multiple joints, allowing them the freedom to move and flexibility.
        Joints are any moveable portions of the robotic arm.<br><br>
        Each joint operates independently while also forming a seamless team with the others for maximum operation. This is how a robotic arm can move up and down while 
        rotating at the same time. In a nutshell, a robotic arm cannot function without joints, and an industrial robotic arm must contain at least two joints.<br><br> 
        The manoeuvrability of the robotic arm increases with the number of joints. These joints-often referred to as axes-are crucial to defining how a robotic arm will function.
        Joints permit freedom of movement and make a robot exceedingly adaptable.<br><br>
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: left;" >
        <li> 
            Joints provide a structure which makes it simple to maintain and repair. Instead of making educated assumptions, 
            it is simple to trace a failure down to a joint once it manifests.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Joints are flexible, allowing the robotic arms to twist, turn, and move up and down.
        </li>
    </ul><br><br>
   </div>
   <h2 id="h2">WHAT IS THE WORK ENVELOPE OF A ROBOTIC ARM?</h2><br>
   <p>
    It is a geometrically shaped area where the manipulator robot may work. It depends on the number of degrees of freedom, size, kind, and range of end effects of the robot, 
    as well as any parts of the robot that may interact with the environment, like a claw, for instance. The number of linear or angular actuators determines the form of the envelope.<br><br>

The work envelope determines the ideal use for the robot. The size and form of the work envelope at the operating site must be specified when selecting or designing a robot for a task. 
To prevent mishaps, the envelope may occasionally need to be constrained by sensors that alert the controller.
   </p><br><br>
   <h2 id="h2">HOW DO ROBOTIC ARMS CONTROL END EFFECTORS?</h2><br>
   <div class="main__img--container">
    <img src="images/arms.jpg" alt="pic" id="main__img2" />
  </div><br>
<div>
   <p>
    A bodily component that activates in response to a stimulus. In robotics, it is a tool used to manipulate things at the end of a robotic arm. The end effector, often referred to as 
    end-of-arm tooling, is located at the end of the robot arm and only moves when a user activates it using the corresponding software.<br><br>

    To put it another way, the end effector is the one which pick and places items, puts product components together, stacks cartons and packages, etc. 
    A robotic arm is required to automate and improve a process, but the end effector allows the robot to work. Different end effectors are suitable for
     various purposes, and the choice of end effectors depends on the task at hand.
   </p><br><br>
   <h2 id="h2">HOW DO ROBOTIC ARMS PERFORM MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS?</h2><br>
   <p>Industrial robotic arms have the flexibility to handle a variety of applications, from the simplest to the most complicated tasks in the safest or harshest conditions. 
    This is one of its main advantages. In addition to removing human workers from potentially dangerous circumstances, automating these kinds of operations frees up such 
    personnel to perform high-value duties like interacting with clients. The following are some of the most widespread applications for robotic arms in manufacturing today:
   </p><br>
   <h3 id="h3">PALLETIZING</h3><br>
   <p>
    Automating the process of loading items or products onto pallets is possible using robotic arms. Palletizing becomes more precise, economical, and predictable when it is automated. 
    Robotic arms provide for the freedom of human employees from dangerous jobs that might result in physical harm.
   </p><br>
   <h3 id="h3">MATERIAL HANDLING</h3><br>
   <p>By ensuring that products and materials are appropriately kept, accessible, or delivered in the right way, material-handling robotic arms may aid in the creation of a secure and effective warehouse.
     Automating these procedures can increase a facility's productivity, speed up the delivery of items to consumers, and reduce worker injuries.</p><br>
   <h3 id="h3">WELDING</h3><br>
   <p>By ensuring that products and materials are appropriately kept, accessible, or delivered in the right way, material-handling robotic arms may aid in the creation of a secure and 
    effective warehouse. Automating these procedures can increase a facility's productivity, speed up the delivery of items to consumers, and reduce worker injuries.</p><br>
   <h3 id="h3">INSPECTION</h3><br>
   <p>It takes longer to identify manufacturing quality problems since the quality inspection is frequently finished after a production line. Businesses may benefit from real-time
     inspection by augmenting robots with vision and AI systems, which helps to cut down on waste and downtime.</p><br>
   <h3 id="h3">PICK AND PLACE</h3><br>
   <div class="main__img--container">
    <img src="images/pick-and-place.jpg" alt="pic" id="main__img3" />
  </div><br>
   <p>Robots that pick and put items are frequently used in logistics and modern production. To accelerate the manufacturing and distribution of commodities,
     they are outfitted with cutting-edge machine vision systems that can swiftly and effectively recognize an object, grip it, and transport it from one place to another.</p><br><br>

     <h2 id="h2">CONCLUSION</h2><br>
     <p>The working of robotic arms is helpful for different industrial and manufacturing purposes that require speed, precision, and repetition. Robotic arms today are used to
         generate a faster return on investment and improve productivity across multiple industries and sectors. It provides a high degree of accuracy and eliminates humans from
         doing hazardous tasks. On top of everything else, they have become much more economical and are often sold with different attachments for assigned duties. So, what are you 
         waiting for? Get a robotic arm today to meet your industry targets today.</p><br><br>
