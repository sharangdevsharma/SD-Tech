      <h1 id="h1" aria-level="3"> WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?</h1><br>
      <p> While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy offers the following definition in this 2004 paper,
      "It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand
       human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."<br><br>
       However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by Alan Turing's seminal work, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence",
       often referred to as the "father of computer science", asks the following question, "Can machines think?"  From there, he offers
       a test, now famously known as the "Turing Test", where a human interrogator would try to distinguish between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much      
       scrutiny since its publish, it remains an important part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around linguistics.<br><br>
       Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig then proceeded to publish, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach  becoming one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into 
       four potential goals or definitions of AI, which differentiates computer systems on the basis of rationality and thinking vs. acting:<br><br>
    <b>Human approach:</b><br><br>
    - Systems that think like humans<br>
    - Systems that act like humans<br><br>
    <b>Ideal approach:</b><br><br>
    -Systems that think rationally<br>
    -Systems that act rationally<br><br>
       Alan Turing’s definition would have fallen under the category of “systems that act like humans.”<br><br>
       At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of
       machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek
       to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data.<br><br>
       Today, a lot of hype still surrounds AI development, which is expected of any new emerging technology in the market. As noted in Gartner’s hype cycle
       product innovations like, self-driving cars and personal assistants, follow “a typical progression of innovation, from overenthusiasm through a period of disillusionment
       to an eventual understanding of the innovation’s relevance and role in a market or domain.” As Lex Fridman notes here,
       we are at the peak of inflated expectations, approaching the trough of disillusionment.<br><br><br>

    <h3 id="h3" aria-level="3"> VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS</h3><br>

    <p>One of the main advantages of artificial intelligence that has changed the
    way a large number of organizations operates is through the introduction
    of virtual assistants. Customers can now get immediate and quick responses
    through programmed virtual assistants who offer quality feedback. The
    other advantage is that most of the feedback provided by virtual
    assistants is customized.</p><br><br>

    <h3  id="h3" aria-label="3">PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS</h3><br>

    <p>Predictive analysis is one of the main advantages of AI-powered
    technology. This technology helps ensure that AI performs forecasting,
    which plays a critical role in predicting the future. Most organizations
    fail because they do not have the necessary skills and technology to
    predict the future or even make an adequate estimation of what could occur
    for that organization. AI technology that offers predictive analysis means
    that organizations have a better chance of predicting future scenarios and
    can plan accordingly.</p><br><br>

    <h3  id="h3" aria-label="3"> BULKING PROCESSING</h3><br>

    <p>Companies always have large amounts of data that they process on a monthly
    basis so that they can come up with decisions to help run the company. The
    problem is that the amount of data that needs to be processed is so huge,
    which makes it difficult to handle. Artificially powered technology helps
    in bulk processing. This phrase means that large amounts of data can be
    processed within a short period and help the company to make sound
    decisions about the management of the company. AI technology is able to
    process large amounts of data at a much faster rate than any human ever
    could.</p><br><br>

    <h3  id="h3" aria-label="3"> ACCURACY OF ANALYSIS</h3><br>

    <p>Most of the tasks handled by individuals are prone human error, which
    means that a large amount of the analysis performed could have errors
    sprinkled throughout it. AI-powered technology is reliable enough in
    completing the analysis that it's preferable to humans doing the work.</p><br><br>

    <h3  id="h3" aria-label="3"> COST EFFECTIVENESS</h3><br>

    <p>A significant number of business owners have a perception that
    implementing artificially powered technology is an expensive undertaking
    for the company. However, they forget that this technology helps in
    cutting costs in other areas of operations, while at the same time making
    the activities of the company more efficient. AI-powered technology might
    be expensive in short-term, but can help an organization save money down
    the road.</p><br><br>
