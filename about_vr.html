        <p>
            When we talk about Virtual Reality (VR), many of us think of science fiction films like 'Minority Report'. 
            However, the truth is that nowadays, this technology completely blends in with our daily lives.
            Video games, medicine, education... Virtual Reality is here to stay. But what is it exactly?

        <h3 id="h3" >WHAT IS VIRTUAL REALITY?</h3><br>
        <p> 
            <strong>
            Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. 
            </strong>
            This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet. VR allows us to immerse ourselves in video games as if we were one of the characters,
            learn how to perform heart surgery or improve the quality of sports training to maximise performance.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Although this may seem extremely futuristic, its origins are not as recent as we might think. In fact, many people consider that one of the first Virtual Reality devices was 
        called Sensorama, a machine with a built-in seat that played 3D movies, gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as vivid as possible. The invention dates 
        back as far as the mid-1950s. Subsequent technological and software developments over the following years brought with them a progressive evolution both in devices and in interface design.
         </p><br><br>
         <h3 id="h3" aria-level="3">DIFFERENCES WITH AUGMENTED REALITY</h3><br>
         <p>
           <b>Despite being a technology that originated decades ago, many people are still unfamiliar with the concept of Virtual Reality.</b> It is also quite common to confuse the term Virtual Reality with augmented reality.<br><br>
            The main difference between the two is that VR builds the world in which we immerse ourselves through a specific headset.<b>It is fully immersive and everything we see is part of an environment artificially
            onstructed through images, sounds, etc.</b> On the other hand, in <b>augmented reality (AR), our own world becomes the framework within which objects, images or similar are placed.</b> Everything we see is in a real
            environment and it may not be strictly necessary to wear a headset. The clearest and most mainstream example of this concept is Pokémon Go.<br><br>
            However, there is also a combination of both realities called mixed reality. This hybrid technology makes it possible, for example, <b>to see virtual objects in the real world and build an
            experience in which the physical and the digital are practically indistinguishable.</b>
         </p><br><br>
         <h3 id="h3" aria-level="3">MAIN APPLICATION OF VIRTUAL REALITY</h3><br>
         <p>
            That's enough about the theory that is projecting us into the future. Which sectors is Virtual Reality actually being used in today? Medicine, culture, education and 
            architecture are some of the areas that have already taken advantage of this technology. From guided museum visits to the dissection of a muscle, VR allows us to cross 
            boundaries that would otherwise be unimaginable.
         </p><br><br>
         <h3 id="h3" aria-level="3">THE FUTUREOF VIRTUAL REALITY</h3><br>
         <p>
            Virtual Reality is one of the technologies with the highest projected potential for growth. According to the latest forecasts from IDC Research (2018), <b>investment in VR
            and AR will multiply 21-fold over the next four years, reaching 15.5 billion euros by 2022.</b> In addition, both technologies will be key to companies' digital transformation 
            plans and their spending in this area will exceed that of the consumer sector by 2019. It is, therefore<b>expected that by 2020 over half of the larger European companies will
            have a VR and RA strategy.</b><br><br>
            Nowadays, the market is demanding applications that go beyond leisure, tourism or marketing and are more affordable for users. Virtual interfaces also need to be improved to avoid 
            defects such as clipping, which makes certain solid objects appear as though they can be passed through. Or to minimise the effects that VR produces in people, among them motion sickness,
            which consists of a dizziness induced by the mismatch between the movement of our body and what is being seen in the virtual world.<br><br>
            The big technology companies are already working to develop headsets that do not need cables and that allow images to be seen in HD. They are developing Virtual Reality headsets 
            in 8K and with much more powerful processors. There is even talk that in the next few years they could integrate Artificial Intelligence. The latest 5G standard can also provide
            very interesting scenarios for the evolution of VR. This standard will allow <b>more devices and large user communities to be connected.</b>In addition, its almost imperceptible latency 
            will make it possible for consumers to receive images in real time, almost as if they were seeing them with their own eyes.<br><br>
            All this means that Virtual Reality is no longer science fiction. It is integrated into our present and, in the coming years, it will lead to advances that will shape the future.
